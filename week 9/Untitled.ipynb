    "<br> A good example of DOE I can think of is in medical testing. To test a new drug and measure it's effectiveness, we can control for different factors like food habits, height, weight, skin color, age group, etc to see if the drug is really effective in treating the corresponding disease.\n",

    "For example we can use two factors such as age -- low age, mid age and old age\n",
